# Sherlock Holmes: Perfect Crime

In this large-scale project, I was responsible for more specialized tasks, including scene lighting, as well as the creation of hero assets and materials. More specifically, this involved producing gameplay-driven content closely tied to the gameplay, such as the “chemical laboratory kits” and “poison decal” featured in the game.
