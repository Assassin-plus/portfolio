# Project Titan

This project is a tutorial-based technical study and validation of Houdini’s procedural workflows, focused on recreating a 3D environment using Unreal Engine 5. The goal was to understand, evaluate, and production-test procedural asset pipelines and workflows introduced in the tutorial series, as well as their integration with modern UE5 technologies. It covers the recreation and optimization of a wide range of digital asset tools, including procedural signage, building generation, rail systems, train destruction FX, VAT characters, trees with wind effects, fences, platforms, shrubs, ivy, trains, cloth, stacking, and cables. Through these exercises, I not only replicated the functionality demonstrated in the tutorials but also gained practical experience in procedural generation, material and VFX creation, simulation optimization, and engine integration, providing a strong foundation for efficiently creating complex game environments.
