# Off Balance


In Off Balance, I focused on creating procedural stylized textures using Substance Designer, including metal grates, concrete, wood, and coated metal rust, while optimizing memory performance through texture compression. I also developed stylized VFX using Niagara, such as smoke and fire, and created ocean materials to enhance the environmental visuals of the game world.
