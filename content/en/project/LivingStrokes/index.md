title: Living Strokes
summary: VR puzzle game in course Rapid Prototype. Aiming to teach Chinese characters. My main part is the AI Optical Character Recognition (OCR) plugin system. I integrate PPOCR-v5, the most advanced open-source model, into Unreal engine, supporting the core gameplay. Besides that, as a tech artist, I also help create the manga stylized shaders, visual effects, environment art design, and all the lighting.
