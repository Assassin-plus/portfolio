#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Ziqi Lu is a graduate student at the University of Utah, majoring in the Master of Entertainment Art and Engineering, Technical Art track. He is  previously an undergraduate student at the Tsinghua University, majoring in Mathematics and Physics + Civil Engineering and Systems.

He is interested in the intersection of computer science and art, with a focus on the development of new algorithms and tools for the creation of digital art of high-fidelity physical correctness as well as expressiveness.

He is also interested in implementing these new-tech tools as a creator, for which I have developed basic skills in digital art, music, and game design.

This website is still under construction. For more information, please refer to his GitHub.
