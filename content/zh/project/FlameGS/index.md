# Reconstructing Detailed Facial Mesh from Monocular or Multicam Videos

July 2024 - Sept. 2024

Research Intern at University of Utahvisor:Yang Yin

* Developed a comprehensive process pipeline to reconstruct photo-realistic facial meshes, textures, and animations from monocular or multi-camera video sources, enhancing the avatar realism and versatility in various applications
* Integrated the FLAME parametric differentiable face model with the Gaussian Splatting method to efffficiently capture detailed features under extreme data distributions
* Formulated a transfer algorithm for further simulation on the mixed avatar representation of meshes and gaussians, which are fully controllable and user-friendly in terms of expression, pose, and viewpoint
* Achieved comparable image similarity and multi-view consistency with state-of-the-art methods, while also producing more temporally smooth pose and expression animations
